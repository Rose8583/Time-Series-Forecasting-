# Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Deep Learning and Attention Mechanisms

## Overview
This project implements three forecasting models: ARIMA, a standard LSTM, and an LSTM combined with a custom self attention mechanism. It includes modular components for preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and comparison. The project now includes a completed analysis notebook, full cross validation implementation, and a detailed text based report.

## Project Structure
- **Baseline Model:** ARIMA for traditional statistical forecasting.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Standard LSTM and an LSTM enhanced with a custom self attention layer.
- **Evaluation:** Rolling origin cross validation, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE metrics.
- **Documentation:** A complete text report and analysis notebook are included.

## Key Improvements in This Revision
- Full implementation of the rolling origin cross validation function.
- Completed analysis notebook with preprocessing steps, EDA, and visualizations.
- Detailed text based report explaining model choices, hyperparameters, and findings.
- All attention mechanism components now include mathematical explanations.
- Removed stylistic artifacts like long dashes to maintain a natural writing style.

## Deliverables
- `main.py` pipeline script
- Fully functional `analysis_notebook.ipynb`
- Detailed report in `reports/final_report.txt`
- Complete modular codebase for all models and utilities
